- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance is very cool! It made coding very effceint and after doing this assignment, I understand how functions can inherit methods and attributes from parent classes. Advice I have for future students is to pay attention during the ancestor tree activity in class. That activity really helped me visualize how classes and subclasses are related and what implications that has. This assignment went well for me especially compared to previous assignments.
